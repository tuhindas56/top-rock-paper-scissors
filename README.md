# top-rock-paper-scissors

Simple rock-paper-scissors project for The Odin Project.

Insights gained from this project:

- Use of Functions
- Event Handling
- Basic DOM manipulation

This is my first proper JavaScript project, a simple rock-paper-scissors game. It helped reinforce some fundamental JavaScript concepts.

**Game Objective**: First to five points wins!
