# top-rockpaperscissors
A simple Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project.

- 17/02/24: Added game logic

Insights gained from this project:

- Use of Functions
- Event Handling

This is my first proper JavaScript project, a simple rock-paper-scissors game. It helped reinforce some fundamental JavaScript concepts.
